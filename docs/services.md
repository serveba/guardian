# Services

In the guardian-clj project we can have several type of services to check. For now we have the following ones:

* **Datasource**: This service abstracts a database service. We can check the connection of the database.
* **Endpoint**: This service abstracts a typical REST/SOAP service endpoint. Through this kind of service we can make request to some status endpoint to see if the service responds correctly, for example: HTTP 200 code, less time than some fixed value...

We are going to describe the EDN structure of the different services through this document.
